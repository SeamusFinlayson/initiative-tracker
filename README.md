## Installing

The extension can be installed from the [store page]().

Pretty Sordid is an initiative tracker based on [Initiative Tracker by Owlbear Rodeo](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/initiative-tracker) but I've made a few quality of life improvements that the community has been requesting for a while.

These are the improvements I sought make with this extension:

* I like having a token image in the initiative because it makes it a lot more readable.
* I added a delete from initiative button because I'm still used to roll20. Hovering over the image reveals the delete button.
* I find the initiative sorting itself while I'm entering a number really disorienting. Did I click the right field when my friend entered their initiative right before I clicked? Where is my cursor? So I added a sort button and made sorting sync across the scene.
* I found selecting the the number and changing it awkward so I centered the text and added hover and focus highlights. Existing text is also auto selected when you click on it.

## How it Works

You can add a character to the initiative by right clicking on it to open the context menu. Then, clicking the Add to Initiative button.

You can remove the character from initiative by clicking the same button.

To change the initiative order you can change its initiative in the action popover and then click sort.

You can move through the initiative order by clicking the arrow icon in the top of the extension popover.
