## Installing

The extension can be installed from the [store page](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/pretty-sordid).

## About

Pretty Sordid is an initiative tracker based on [Initiative Tracker by Owlbear Rodeo](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/initiative-tracker) but I've made a few quality of life improvements that the community has been requesting for a while.

Features:

- Token images are displayed in the initiative
- Tokens can be removed through the initiative menu
- The initiative can be sorted in ascending or descending order using the sort button
- The initiative value input has hover and focus highlights
- The current round can be tracked
- You can use alternating style initiative (useful for the Draw Steel RPG)

## How it Works

You can add a character to the initiative by right clicking on it to open the context menu. Then, clicking the Add to Initiative button.

You can remove the character from initiative by clicking the same button or hovering over the token's icon in the initiative list and then clicking the X that appears there. If you're using a touch screen, just tap the image.

To change the initiative order you can change its initiative in the action popover and then click sort.

You can move through the initiative order by clicking the arrow icon in the top of the extension popover.

## Alternating Initiative

A more free form and tactical initiative system where the party and their adversaries alternate taking turns.

This can be enabled through the settings menu.

This is inspired by how initiative in Draw Steel, the MCDM RPG, works but I run a D&D 5E game so here is how I am using this in my game:

- One player (the one with the best initiative) rolls against a monster (the one with the best initiative) to decide which side goes first
- The side that goes first decides amongst themselves which character takes their turn (click the flag beside that character) then the other side does the same
- The two sides continue alternating turns like this until one side is out of characters
- The side that still has characters who have not acted takes all their remaining turns
- Reset the initiative for the next round, the side that won the initiative contest at the beginning acts first again
